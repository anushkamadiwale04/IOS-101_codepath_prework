## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

The app should have a simple and intuitive user interface.
The main screen should display three labels: "Red", "Green", and "Blue".
There should be a button labeled "Change Color".
When the user taps the "Change Color" button, the screen color should change to a random pastel color.
The random color should be generated using RGB values within a specific range to ensure pastel colors.
The app should provide a visually pleasing experience with smooth color transitions.
Consider adding animations or transitions to enhance the user experience.
The app should be compatible with different screen sizes and orientations.
Implement error handling to gracefully handle any unexpected issues.
Test the app thoroughly on different devices and iOS versions to ensure compatibility and performance.
Consider adding additional features such as a color picker or the ability to save favorite colors.
Prioritize simplicity, usability, and visual appeal in the design and functionality of the app.

## App Idea: Fitness Tracker+
I would like to build a fitness tracking app called Fitness Tracker+. The app aims to provide users with a comprehensive platform to track their fitness activities and progress. Some of the features I would like to implement are:

- Workout tracking: Users can log their workouts, including details such as exercise type, duration, and intensity. The app will provide statistics and insights on their workout history.
Goal setting: Users can set fitness goals, such as weight loss or running distance, and track their progress towards achieving those goals. The app will provide motivational reminders and progress tracking.
- Social community: The app will include a social component where users can connect with friends, join fitness challenges, and share their achievements, providing a supportive and motivating environment.
By combining workout tracking, goal setting, and a social community, Fitness Tracker+ aims to help users stay motivated, track their fitness journey, and achieve their health and wellness goals.
